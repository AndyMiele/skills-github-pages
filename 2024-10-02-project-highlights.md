As part of my undergraduate journey, I've had the opportunity to work on several impactful projects. Below are some highlights:

### 1. Senior Design Project - Eddy Current Airfoil De-Icing
In collaboration with **Pratt & Whitney**, my team developed a novel use for eddy current sensors in airfoil de-icing. This project gave me the chance to apply my knowledge of **electromagnetism**, **heat transfer**, and **finite element analysis** using **ANSYS Maxwell**.

### 2. Hybrid Electric Propulsion Tool
In this project, I helped design a tool for sizing hybrid-electric propulsion systems for regional aerial mobility (RAM) aircraft. This involved researching battery specifications, mass, and endurance requirements to generate viable design recommendations.

### 3. Production and Tooling at Ebmpapst
During my internship at **Ebmpapst**, I created a Python-based design tool for generating prototype inlet rings, integrating with **SolidWorks**. I also worked with the production team to design, fabricate, and test parts for manufacturing.

These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also given me a deeper appreciation for the collaborative nature of engineering.

Stay tuned for more project deep dives!
